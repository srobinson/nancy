<objective>
Update remaining Nancy skills and verify all skills trigger correctly.

Purpose: Complete skill improvements and validate they work as expected.
Output: All 7 skills updated with best practices, verified working via human testing.

**Skills to update:**
@skills/check-directives/SKILL.md
@skills/send-message/SKILL.md
@skills/create-spec/SKILL.md
@skills/orchestrator/SKILL.md
@skills/update-spec/SKILL.md

**Already fixed in Plan 01:**

- check-tokens (trigger-rich, third-person, prettier-ignore)
- session-history (trigger-rich, third-person, prettier-ignore)

**RESEARCH.md recommendations applied:**

- All descriptions single-line
- `# prettier-ignore` before each description
- Third-person voice
- Trigger-rich language
  </context>

  <name>Task 1: Update remaining skills with best practices</name>

  <action>
For each of the 5 remaining skills, apply RESEARCH.md patterns:

**check-directives/SKILL.md:**

- Already has good description, but add `# prettier-ignore` for safety
- Keep: "Check for orchestrator messages. Use at turn start, after major tasks, and ALWAYS before marking task complete."

**send-message/SKILL.md:**

- Add `# prettier-ignore`
- Current is OK but could be more trigger-rich: "Send a message to the orchestrator. Use for blockers, progress updates, requesting review, or communicating status during autonomous execution."

**create-spec/SKILL.md:**

- Add `# prettier-ignore`
- Review description for trigger-richness (currently good)

**orchestrator/SKILL.md:**

- Add `# prettier-ignore`
- Review description (currently good)

**update-spec/SKILL.md:**

- Add `# prettier-ignore`
- Current: "Mark success criteria as complete in SPEC.md. Use when a criterion has been verified and should be checked off."
- May add: "Triggers on: check off criterion, mark complete, update spec."

**For each update:**

1. Add `# prettier-ignore` comment before description line
2. Ensure description is single-line
3. Improve trigger language if needed (don't over-engineer if already good)
   </action>

  <verify>
- grep -c "prettier-ignore" skills/*/SKILL.md | grep -v ":0" (all should show :1)
- for f in skills/*/SKILL.md; do head -4 "$f"; done (all descriptions single-line)
  </verify>
  <done>All 5 remaining skills have prettier-ignore comments and optimized single-line descriptions</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create skills documentation summary</name>
  <files>skills/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create a README.md in skills/ directory documenting:

1. **Overview:** What Nancy skills are and how they work
2. **Character Budget:** Note the 15k limit and current usage
3. **Skill Inventory:** Table of all 7 skills with:
   - Name
   - Description (truncated)
   - Primary triggers
4. **Best Practices Applied:** Reference to RESEARCH.md patterns
5. **Maintenance Notes:** How to add new skills without breaking budget

This serves as living documentation for skill maintenance.
</action>
<verify>cat skills/README.md shows documentation with all 7 skills listed</verify>
<done>skills/README.md created with inventory, budget tracking, and maintenance guidance</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Updated all 7 Nancy skills with Claude Code best practices for reliable triggering</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open a new Claude Code session in the nancy project
    2. Run: /skills - verify all 7 skills appear
    3. Test check-tokens: Type "check my context usage" - should invoke skill
    4. Test session-history: Type "what did we do last session" - should invoke skill
    5. Test check-directives: Type "check for orchestrator messages" - should invoke skill
    6. Verify no "I don't have that skill" responses for documented triggers
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all skills trigger correctly, or describe which skills aren't triggering</resume-signal>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] All 7 skills have `# prettier-ignore` before description
- [ ] All descriptions are single-line
- [ ] skills/README.md exists with inventory
- [ ] Human verified skills trigger correctly in new session
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All 7 Nancy skills updated with best practices
- skills/README.md documents inventory and budget
- Human verification confirms skills trigger on natural language
- Phase 3.1 complete
  </success_criteria>
