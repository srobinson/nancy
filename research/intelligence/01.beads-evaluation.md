# Initiative: Beads Evaluation - Right Tool for Nancy?

## Context

We're planning to use **beads** (https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) as the storage format for:
- User identity and preferences
- Project context and metadata
- Code style configurations
- Cross-project learning data

Before committing to this architecture, we need to validate beads is the right fit.

## Core Requirements for Nancy

1. **Human-readable and editable**: Developers should be able to view/edit without special tools
2. **Structured data**: Support nesting, types, arrays, objects
3. **Composable**: Multiple bead files should merge/combine cleanly
4. **Schema-validatable**: Ability to validate structure
5. **Version-controllable**: Works well with git
6. **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, Windows
7. **Programming language support**: Easy to read/write from TypeScript/Node
8. **Performance**: Fast read/write for 100+ project beads
9. **Querying**: Ability to search/filter across beads
10. **Evolution-friendly**: Can add fields without breaking existing data

## Questions to Answer

1. **What exactly IS beads?** - Current capabilities, maturity, adoption
2. **What are the alternatives?** - Other structured storage formats for similar use cases
3. **Comparison**: How do alternatives stack up against our requirements?
4. **Risk assessment**: What are the risks of choosing beads vs alternatives?
5. **Migration path**: If we choose wrong, how hard to switch later?

## Research Focus

- Beads deep dive (capabilities, limitations, community, maturity)
- Alternative formats (YAML, TOML, JSON5, HCL, others)
- Developer tool precedents (what do similar tools use?)
- Storage patterns in LLM/AI tools
- Data portability considerations
