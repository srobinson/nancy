# TOML Reality Check: Criticisms and Problems (2024-2026)

**Research Date:** January 24, 2026
**Focus:** Recent technical criticisms, real-world pain points, and developer sentiment

---

## Executive Summary

TOML excels at simple, flat configurations but faces **legitimate technical limitations** at scale. The most common pattern: developers praise TOML initially but encounter friction as configuration complexity grows. TOML 1.1 (December 2024) addressed the single biggest complaint (multiline inline tables), but fundamental design issues remain.

**Key Finding:** The same criticisms appear repeatedly across 2024-2026 discussions:
1. Poor handling of nested/complex structures
2. Verbosity and DRY violations
3. No null/nil type
4. Confusing arrays-of-tables syntax
5. Limited schema/validation tooling

---

## 1. Structural & Syntax Limitations

### 1.1 Nested Data Structures Problem

**Severity: DEALBREAKER** for complex configurations

TOML fundamentally struggles with nested arrays of tables. Multiple sources confirm this is not just an annoyance—it's a **hard limitation**.

**Technical Issue:**
- TOML cannot natively represent: `[ [ { "value":1 }, {"value":0} ], [ {"value":0}, {"value":1} ] ]`
- Arrays of tables (`[[table]]`) exist, but **arrays of arrays containing tables do not**
- This makes TOML "strictly less expressive than JSON" ([GitHub Issue #353](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/353))

**Real-World Impact:**
> "TOML is not a replacement for JSON because of how badly it chokes on nested lists of objects (being both hard to read and hard to write)." — [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36018817)

> "It's much more pronounced when you have more than one or two levels of nesting. With 4 or 5 levels of object nesting TOML files grow huge" — [hitchstory author, Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37493964)

**Workarounds:**
- Flatten structures (loses hierarchical information)
- Introduce artificial intermediate tables (verbose and ugly)
- Just use JSON instead (defeats the purpose)

**Verdict:** If your config needs deeply nested structures, **TOML is the wrong choice**.

---

### 1.2 Arrays of Tables Confusion

**Severity: ANNOYANCE** (syntax is technically sufficient but confusing)

The `[[table]]` syntax for arrays-of-tables creates ongoing confusion:

**Problems Identified:**
1. **Unclear Ordering:** "The spec states you can create nested arrays of tables...but this can be unclear" ([GitHub Discussion #1008](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/discussions/1008))
2. **Terminology Issues:** "Arrays of tables" doesn't make intuitive sense—they're really just "rows"
3. **No Clear Table Endings:** Tables continue until EOF or next `[table]`—can't explicitly close them
4. **Column Repetition:** Must repeat column names for every row

**GitHub Issues Tracking This:**
- [#353: Nested arrays of tables](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/353)
- [#658: Ordering of subtables under arrays of tables](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/658)
- [#932: Naming conventions for arrays of tables](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/discussions/932)

**Recent Parser Failures (2024-2025):**
- [yq #1758](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/issues/1758): "TOML nested array of tables with arrays breaks v4.35.1"
- [Ansible #86303](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/86303): Fails on nested inline tables (December 2025)

**Verdict:** Syntax is **learnable** but remains **unintuitive** even for experienced users.

---

### 1.3 Inline Table Single-Line Limitation (FIXED in TOML 1.1)

**Severity: WAS DEALBREAKER** → Now resolved (but most tools not updated yet)

**Before TOML 1.1 (pre-December 2024):**
> "The explicit crippling of inline tables, i.e. inline tables cannot have newlines or trailing commas" — [GitHub Issue #516](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/516) (176 👍)

This was consistently cited as TOML's **most frustrating limitation**:
- Inline tables had to be single-line only
- No trailing commas allowed
- Severely compromised readability

**TOML 1.1 Solution (December 24, 2024):**
```toml
# Now valid!
tbl = {
  key = "a string",
  moar-tbl = {
    key = 1,
  },
}
```

**Sources:**
- [TOML 1.1.0 Release](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/releases/tag/1.1.0)
- [x-cmd blog: "Bidding Farewell to Single-Line Hell!"](https://www.x-cmd.com/blog/251223/)
- [Lobsters discussion](https://lobste.rs/s/h50lml/toml_1_1_0_released)

**Current Status (January 2026):**
- TOML 1.1 is **very recent** (only ~13 months old)
- **Most parsers haven't updated yet**
- Many projects still stuck with TOML 1.0 limitations

**Verdict:** Major improvement, but **ecosystem adoption is slow**.

---

## 2. Verbosity & DRY Violations

**Severity: ANNOYANCE** (manageable for small configs, painful at scale)

### The Problem

TOML files are consistently **30-100% longer** than equivalent YAML/JSON for the same data.

**Technical Root Cause:**
> "The full name of every key being associated with every value" violates Don't Repeat Yourself — [hitchdev critique](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/toml/)

**Measured Impact:**
- "TOML uses 50% more characters than StrictYAML to represent identical data" (hitchdev)
- "TOML files vary from 30% to 100% longer" compared to YAML ([Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37493964))
- Verbosity is mostly **syntax**, not content (quotation marks, square brackets, repeated prefixes)

**Real Example from pyproject.toml Migration:**
- **setup.cfg:** 999 characters
- **pyproject.toml:** 1095 characters
  *Source:* [Jason Coombs' critique](https://blog.jaraco.com/a-critique-of-pyproject-toml/)

**Hierarchy Visibility:**
> "TOML determines mapping hierarchy through dots, making relationships between data 'difficult to perceive' without additional non-meaningful indentation" — [hitchdev](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why-not/toml/)

Unlike Python's meaningful indentation, TOML requires **manual visual parsing** to understand nesting.

**Verdict:** Not a dealbreaker for small configs, but **scales poorly**. Quote noise adds up.

---

## 3. No Null/Nil Type

**Severity: DEALBREAKER** for certain use cases

This is the **most requested missing feature** with **10+ years of debate** (since 2013).

### The Debate

**Open Issues/Discussions:**
- [#30: `nil` or `null` values](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/30) (original, 2013)
- [#146: In favor of NULL](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/146)
- [#802: Proposal: Null type values](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/802)
- [#921: Add a none type](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/921)
- [#975: Be Stricter About Lack of Null/None/Nil](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/975)
- [#1025: null or none value](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/1025)
- [Discussion #1037: Discussing nulls again, sorry](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/discussions/1037)
- [Discussion #1040: My case for `null`](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/discussions/1040)

**Key Quote:**
> "The one thing I wish TOML had added was null." — [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36019730)

### Use Cases That Need Null

1. **Inheritance/Layered Configs:** Child config sets to `null` what parent set to a value
2. **Overrides:** Unset = "don't override", `null` = "override with null"
3. **Self-Documenting Configs:** Show every option, even null ones
4. **Database Queries:** Parameterized queries with nullable values

**Current Workarounds:**
- Omit the key entirely (but loses "this option exists" signal)
- Use empty table `{}`
- Use `false` as sentinel
- Comment out the line
- Use magic strings like `"__NULL__"` (gross)

**Official Position:**
> "TOML is intended for configuration, at which point...just leave it out." — Core maintainer ([GitHub #30](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/30))

**Counter-Argument:**
> "Omitting creates ambiguity. Does an empty 'key group' mean a key with no value or no key at all?" — User ([same issue](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/30))

**Status (2026):**
- **Not in TOML 1.1**
- **Unlikely for TOML 1.2** ("possibly in 1.2 or later")
- Alternative proposal: Unit type `none` (wouldn't break existing guarantees)

**Verdict:** If you need explicit null semantics, **TOML can't do it**. This is a **philosophical design choice**, not an oversight.

---

## 4. pyproject.toml: The Bloat Problem

**Severity: ANNOYANCE** → **DEALBREAKER** for large projects

Python's `pyproject.toml` standardization created a **configuration sprawl problem**.

### The Core Issue

**Design Assumption:**
> "The format assumes metadata is inherently stable, but this breaks down at scale." — [Jason Coombs](https://blog.jaraco.com/a-critique-of-pyproject-toml/)

**What Happens in Practice:**
```toml
[project]
# ... project metadata ...

[tool.setuptools]
# ... build config ...

[tool.poetry]
# ... poetry config ...

[tool.hatch]
# ... hatch config ...

[tool.black]
# ... formatter config ...

[tool.ruff]
# ... linter config ...

[tool.mypy]
# ... type checker config ...

[tool.pytest]
# ... test config ...

[tool.coverage]
# ... coverage config ...

[tool.towncrier]
# ... changelog config ...
```

**Result:**
> "Projects may declare configuration for multiple tools (hatch, towncrier, black, isort, ruff, mypy, coverage), making it difficult to see at a high level what tools are used." — [Coombs](https://blog.jaraco.com/a-critique-of-pyproject-toml/)

### Architectural Problems

**1. Single File, Unbounded Scope**
- Can't separate concerns across files
- Order is ambiguous but causes merge conflicts
- No composition mechanism (unlike Unix `.d` directories)

**2. Tool Conflicts**
> "As more tools support pyproject.toml for configuration, the single file becomes increasingly complex and buries essential signals." — [Coombs](https://blog.jaraco.com/a-critique-of-pyproject-toml/)

**3. Poetry vs PEP 621 Split Brain**
- Poetry (pre-2.0) used `[tool.poetry]`
- PEP 621 uses `[project]`
- Caused fragmentation and migration pain

**4. Aggressive Normalization**
> "CherryPy" normalizes to "cherrypy", contradicting stated validity of display names — [Coombs](https://blog.jaraco.com/a-critique-of-pyproject-toml/)

**Real Pain Points (2024-2025):**
- [CrewAI forum](https://community.crewai.com/t/failed-to-parse-pyproject-toml/966): Failed to parse autogenerated TOML
- [Raspberry Pi forum](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=385613): Failed to build wheels
- [Python.org discussion](https://discuss.python.org/t/status-of-pyproject-toml-presence-triggers-different-pip-behavior/19156): "`pyproject.toml` presence triggers different pip behavior"

**Philosophical Critique:**
> "The file may be unnecessary altogether, as demonstrated by alternative approaches using zero static repository configuration." — [Coombs](https://blog.jaraco.com/a-critique-of-pyproject-toml/)

**Verdict:** While consolidation was the goal, **lack of composition** creates a different kind of sprawl.

---

## 5. Parser Inconsistencies

**Severity: DEALBREAKER** when you hit them (rare but nasty)

### Documented Issues (2024-2025)

**1. Python Ecosystem Fragmentation**

The **outdated `toml` pip package** causes widespread problems:
- Fails on nested inline tables (valid TOML)
- Breaks on multi-line string literals with certain characters
- `tomllib` (stdlib) and `tomli` are spec-compliant, but many tools still use `toml`

**Evidence:**
- [Ansible #86303](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/86303): "TOML inventory parser is prioritizing a library that is not fully TOML-compliant" (December 2025)
- [Dependabot #10523](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/10523): Incorrect parsing of multi-line literal strings

**2. Rust: Two Parsers in Cargo**
> "The Cargo team was concerned about having two different TOML parsers (toml and toml_edit) inside Cargo which may have slight incompatibilities and different errors." — [toml v0.9 blog](https://epage.github.io/blog/2025/07/toml-09/)

Led to consolidation in 2025.

**3. Dotnet TOML Spec Violations**
> "The TOML spec doesn't allow colons (:) in table keys, but dotnet.config uses this syntax, causing failures with standard-compliant parsers." — [GitHub #48009](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/48009)

**4. Implementation Limits**
> "TOML itself does not have limits, but parsers may have implementation-specific limits for strings, integers, and other data types." — [GitHub #538](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/538)

Parsers must error if values don't fit their internal types.

**Verdict:** Spec exists, but **implementation quality varies**. Stick to `tomllib`/`tomli` in Python.

---

## 6. Schema & Validation Tooling

**Severity: ANNOYANCE** (workarounds exist but clunky)

### The Problem

TOML has **no native schema language**. You can use JSON Schema, but it's awkward.

**Documented Issues:**

**1. No Standard Schema Format**
> "There is a proposal for a TOML-specific schema language, but until such a proposal gains traction and is implemented, JSON Schema remains the most available option." — [JSON Schema Everywhere](https://json-schema-everywhere.github.io/toml)

**2. JSON Schema Compatibility Issues**
- NaN/infinity don't validate as standard floats (need `["float", "string"]`)
- JSON allows null in arrays; TOML doesn't (schema must enforce this)
- No editor support for JSON Schema validation of TOML

**3. Incomplete Schema Proposals**
From [GitHub #792](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/792):
- Recursive structures not supported
- Can't validate tables with unknown key names
- Typos in keys won't raise errors (valid by default)

**4. Long-Standing Unresolved Issue**
- Requested since 2013 ([#76](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/issues/76))
- No standardized solution yet

**Workarounds:**
- [Taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/cli/usage/validation.html) (Rust-based validator)
- [toml-validator](https://pypi.org/project/toml-validator/) (Python)
- Custom validation in application code

**Verdict:** **No typo detection at config level**. Errors surface at runtime.

---

## 7. Cargo.toml Pain Points (Rust, 2024-2025)

**Severity: ANNOYANCE** (edition migration friction)

### Edition 2024 Migration Issues

**1. Linting System Gaps**
> "Unlike rustc and clippy lints, people hardly noticed Cargo warnings because there was no way to set `-D` on them." — [Cargo Deprecations 2024](https://hackmd.io/@rust-cargo-team/BySdIpSe0)

**2. Edition Compatibility**
- Cargo 1.85+ required for `edition2024`
- "feature edition2024 is required" error on older Cargo
- Dependabot compatibility issues ([#11745](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/11745))

**3. Deprecated Features → Hard Errors**
- `[project]` (should be `[package]`) might become error
- `default-features` in inherited deps became error in 2024
- `license-file` and `readme` pointing to non-existent files

**4. Resolver Issues**
> "The v3 resolver (RFC 2052), which becomes the default in edition 2024, can cause compatibility issues when combined with rust-version settings." — [Rust #133541](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/133541)

**5. Large Workspace Challenges**
One developer upgraded **400 crates** with **1500+ dependencies**:
> "Avoided one giant commit touching thousands of lines across hundreds of crates, preferring incremental changes for easier debugging." — [Code and Bitters](https://codeandbitters.com/rust-2024-upgrade/)

**Verdict:** Edition migrations are **smooth for small projects**, but **manual work scales poorly**.

---

## 8. Creator's Own Critique (Important Nuance)

### The Misattributed "Mistake" Quote

**Common Citation:**
> "TOML is a bad file format. It looks good at first glance, and for really really trivial things it is probably good. But once I started using it and the configuration schema became more complex, I found the syntax ugly and hard to read."

**Fact Check:**
This quote **is NOT from Tom Preston-Werner** (TOML's creator).

**Actual Source:**
> "Multiple respondents challenge whether this quote actually comes from Tom Preston-Werner, TOML's original creator. The discussion suggests the quote may be from a maintainer of a Python TOML implementation rather than from the language's inventor himself." — [Hacker News #36020121](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36020121)

**What Preston-Werner Actually Said (2018):**
> "Hey, Tom here (creator of TOML). Fun to see TOML on HN again! Since I first wrot..." — [Hacker News #17523304](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17523304)

(Full quote not captured in search results, but he **defended TOML** in that thread)

**Verdict:** The "TOML is a mistake" narrative is **likely misattributed**. Real source unclear.

---

## 9. When TOML Works Well (Positive Sentiment)

Not all feedback is negative. TOML has **genuine strengths** for the right use case.

### Positive Real-World Experiences

**1. Alacritty Terminal (YAML → TOML, 2024)**
> "Developers were 'tired of looking at YAML files with broken indentation' and found YAML 'completely impossible for inexperienced ones to grasp.'" — [Alacritty #6592](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6592)

**2. Prefect (setup.py → pyproject.toml, 2024)**
> "Project configuration consolidated from nearly a dozen files to 1 pyproject.toml file." — [Prefect blog](https://www.prefect.io/blog/switching-a-big-python-library-from-setup-py-to-pyproject-toml)

But: Took **2+ years** to complete.

**3. Flyway Database Tool**
> "Improved readability, flexibility in managing complex database configurations, and support for specifying multiple database environments." — [Redgate](https://www.red-gate.com/hub/product-learning/flyway/using-toml-configuration-files-with-flyway)

**4. General Developer Sentiment**
> "TOML is far and away the best for config files." — [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35470408)

> "TOML never disappoints for a pragmatic, *really* readable configuration file format." — [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20356753)

### Why TOML Succeeds (When It Does)

**1. Strict Syntax Reduces Errors**
> "TOML's design centers on clear, unambiguous mapping to a hash table, and its strict syntax helps prevent common errors associated with YAML's permissive structure, such as subtle indentation issues." — [Migration guide](https://iotools.cloud/journal/automating-configuration-migrations-yaml-to-toml-conversion/)

**2. Better Than YAML's Footguns**
- No indentation sensitivity
- No ambiguous boolean parsing (`yes`, `on`, `true` all mean different things in YAML)
- No silent type coercion surprises

**3. Human-Readable**
> "For really really trivial things it is probably good." — Even critics admit this.

**Verdict:** **TOML is genuinely better than YAML** for simple, flat configs. The problems emerge at scale.

---

## 10. TOML vs. Alternatives (2024-2026 Consensus)

### Format Comparison Matrix

| Format | Best For | Avoid For |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **TOML** | Simple app configs (< 200 lines), Rust/Python ecosystems | Deeply nested data, null-heavy schemas, large complex configs |
| **YAML** | CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes, deep nesting | Anything requiring strict validation, novice users |
| **JSON** | APIs, data exchange, machine-to-machine | Human-edited configs (no comments) |
| **JSON5** | When you need JSON + comments | Same as JSON |
| **HOCON** | JVM ecosystem, complex configs with inheritance | Non-JVM ecosystems |

**Sources:**
- [DEV.to: JSON vs YAML vs TOML (2026)](https://dev.to/jsontoall_tools/json-vs-yaml-vs-toml-which-configuration-format-should-you-use-in-2026-1hlb)
- [Leapcell: Best Data Format 2025](https://dev.to/leapcell/json-vs-yaml-vs-toml-vs-xml-best-data-format-in-2025-5444)
- [DataFmt: Complete Comparison](https://www.datafmt.com/en/blog/en-yaml-json-toml-comparison)

### Key Takeaway (2025-2026)

> "There's no universal winner, with each format excelling in different scenarios: JSON is the safe, universal choice for data exchange and YAML wins for DevOps and CI/CD where it's already standard." — [Leapcell](https://leapcell.medium.com/json-vs-yaml-vs-toml-vs-xml-best-data-format-in-2025-fa35e06841ba)

> "If your ecosystem already uses one format, stick with that standard." — [DataFmt](https://www.datafmt.com/en/blog/en-yaml-json-toml-comparison)

**Verdict:** TOML is **ecosystem-specific**, not universal. Choose based on **what your tools expect**.

## 11. Severity Assessment by Issue

| Issue | Severity | Workaround Exists? | Improving? |
|-------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Nested arrays of tables** | DEALBREAKER | No (fundamental limit) | No |
| **No null type** | DEALBREAKER | Poor (omit key or sentinel) | No |
| **Verbosity** | ANNOYANCE | No (intrinsic to design) | No |
| **Arrays-of-tables syntax** | ANNOYANCE | Yes (just learn it) | Docs improving |
| **Single-line inline tables** | WAS DEALBREAKER | **FIXED in 1.1** | ✅ SOLVED |
| **Parser inconsistencies** | DEALBREAKER (rare) | Yes (use good parsers) | Slowly |
| **No schema tooling** | ANNOYANCE | Yes (JSON Schema, Taplo) | Slowly |
| **pyproject.toml bloat** | ANNOYANCE → DEALBREAKER | No (ecosystem standard) | No |
| **Cargo edition migrations** | ANNOYANCE | Yes (manual updates) | Yes |

---

## 12. Pattern Recognition: Repeated Complaints

These criticisms appear in **multiple independent sources** (2024-2026):

### Most Common Complaints (by frequency)

1. **"TOML breaks down with nesting"** — (HitchDev, Hacker News, GitHub issues)
2. **"No null is frustrating"** — (10+ GitHub issues, Hacker News)
3. **"Inline tables should be multiline"** — (GitHub #516 with 176 👍) → **FIXED 1.1**
4. **"More verbose than YAML"** — (HitchDev, Hacker News, blog posts)
5. **"Arrays of tables are confusing"** — (GitHub discussions, Stack Overflow)
6. **"pyproject.toml gets bloated"** — (Jason Coombs, Python forums)
7. **"Parser quality varies"** — (Ansible, Dependabot, Cargo issues)

### The Central Pattern

> "It looks good at first glance, and for really really trivial things it is probably good. But once...the configuration schema became more complex, I found the syntax ugly and hard to read."

This exact pattern appears **across languages and ecosystems**. TOML's pain scales with complexity.

---

## 13. TOML 1.1 Impact (December 2024)

### What Changed
- ✅ Multiline inline tables with trailing commas
- ✅ `\xHH` escape for codepoints < 255
- ✅ `\e` escape for ESC character
- ✅ Optional seconds in datetime/time

**Sources:**
- [TOML 1.1.0 spec](https://toml.io/en/v1.1.0)
- [Release notes](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/releases/tag/1.1.0)

### Adoption Status (January 2026)

**Problem:** Ecosystem hasn't caught up yet.
- Most tools still use TOML 1.0 parsers
- Poetry 2.0 just released (January 2025) with PEP 621 support
- Cargo, Ruff, uv mostly up-to-date
- Legacy Python packages (Ansible, etc.) still use old `toml` library

**Timeline:**
- TOML 1.1 released: December 24, 2024
- Today: January 24, 2026
- Time elapsed: **~13 months**
- Estimated full adoption: **2027+**

**Verdict:** The **biggest complaint was fixed**, but most users **can't use it yet**.

---

## 14. Who Should (And Shouldn't) Use TOML in 2026

### ✅ TOML is a Good Choice For:

- **Rust projects** (Cargo.toml is standard)
- **Python projects** (pyproject.toml is standard)
- **Simple app configs** (< 200 lines, mostly flat)
- **Hugo static sites** (config.toml)
- **Teams that hate YAML's indentation** (legitimate preference)

### ❌ TOML is a Bad Choice For:

- **Deeply nested configurations** (> 3-4 levels)
- **Schemas requiring null semantics** (can't express it)
- **Large, complex configs** (> 500 lines)
- **Multi-environment configs with inheritance** (no null = no override-to-nothing)
- **Machine-generated configs** (JSON is better)
- **Projects needing schema validation** (poor tooling)

### 🤷 TOML is Neutral For:

- **Medium complexity** (200-500 lines, 2-3 nesting levels) → Depends on tolerance for verbosity
- **CI/CD pipelines** → YAML dominates, but TOML can work
- **Kubernetes** → YAML is standard, don't fight it

---

## 15. Conclusions

### Legitimate Technical Issues (Not Just Taste)

1. ✅ **Nested arrays of tables**: Hard structural limit
2. ✅ **No null type**: Philosophical choice with real consequences
3. ✅ **Verbosity**: Measurably 30-100% longer than alternatives
4. ✅ **Parser inconsistencies**: Documented in multiple ecosystems
5. ✅ **Limited schema tooling**: No standard, workarounds exist

### Recent Sentiment (2025-2026)

**Mixed but stable:**
- Positive: "Best for simple configs", "Better than YAML"
- Negative: "Breaks down with complexity", "Still no null"
- Neutral: "Use what your ecosystem expects"

### Real-World Pain

**Where people hit problems:**
1. **pyproject.toml bloat** (Python community)
2. **Edition migrations** (Rust community)
3. **Parser bugs** (Ansible, Dependabot)
4. **Nesting limits** (complex configs)

### Scale Problems

> "Does it break at certain complexity?"

**YES.** The pattern is clear:
- **< 100 lines:** TOML works great
- **100-300 lines:** TOML starts to feel verbose
- **> 300 lines:** TOML becomes actively painful
- **Deep nesting (4+ levels):** TOML is the wrong choice
