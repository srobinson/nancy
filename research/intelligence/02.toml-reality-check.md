# Initiative: TOML Reality Check - 2026 Edition

## Context

Previous research recommended TOML as a primary format for Nancy configuration. However, there are known detractors and criticisms of TOML in the community.

Before committing to TOML, we need to understand:
1. What are the **specific criticisms** of TOML in 2025-2026?
2. What are **modern tools launched/updated in 2025-2026** actually using?
3. Are there **emerging formats** we haven't considered?
4. Is TOML's momentum real or hype?

## Questions to Answer

1. **TOML Criticisms**: What are the legitimate technical complaints?
2. **2026 Cool Kids**: What formats do the newest, most innovative tools choose?
3. **Emerging Alternatives**: Any new formats gaining traction (2024-2026)?
4. **Format Wars**: Is there a clear winner emerging or still fragmented?
5. **LLM-Native Formats**: Any formats designed specifically for LLM tooling?

## Research Focus

- Recent blog posts, HN discussions, Reddit threads about TOML problems
- Tools launched in 2025-2026 (AI tools, CLI tools, build tools)
- Emerging configuration languages (CUE, Dhall, Nickel, others)
- Format preferences in LLM/AI agent ecosystems
- Developer sentiment analysis (what people actually choose vs recommend)

## Success Criteria

- Understand if TOML recommendation is sound or dated
- Identify any blind spots in previous research
- Get real-world 2026 perspective on format choices
- Make informed decision based on current momentum
