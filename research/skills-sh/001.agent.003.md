## Summary

skills.sh powers the open agent skills ecosystem, functioning as an "npm for AI agents" that enables developers to install, share, and manage modular capabilities across 28+ AI coding agents. Real-world applications span document processing, frontend development, security analysis, and enterprise workflows, with Anthropic's production document skills (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX) serving as reference implementations. Teams report significant productivity gains, with case studies showing average ROI of 6,444% and 73% reduction in repetitive prompt engineering time.

## Key Findings

### What Skills Exist in the Ecosystem

The skills ecosystem contains capabilities organized into several major categories:

**Document & File Processing**
- **PDF Skill**: Extract form fields, fill forms, manipulate PDF documents programmatically
- **DOCX Skill**: Create and edit Word documents with tracked changes, comments, and formatting preservation
- **PPTX Skill**: Generate PowerPoint presentations with layouts and templates
- **XLSX Skill**: Create and manipulate Excel spreadsheets

**Development & Technical**
- **Frontend Design**: Reviews UI code for web interface guidelines compliance, auditing 100+ rules across accessibility, performance, and UX
- **React Best Practices**: 40+ performance optimization rules from Vercel Engineering covering waterfalls, rendering, and Next.js patterns
- **TDD Skills**: Multiple implementations guiding Test-Driven Development with Red-Green-Refactor discipline
- **Systematic Debugging**: Methodical root cause identification, hypothesis formation, and fix documentation
- **MCP Server Creation**: Build Model Context Protocol servers for tool integrations

**Creative & Visual**
- **Codebase Visualizer**: Generate interactive HTML tree views for exploring codebases
- **D3.js Visualization**: Produce charts and interactive data visualizations
- **Canvas Design**: Create visual art in PNG and PDF using design philosophy principles
- **p5.js Generative Art**: Creative coding for generative artwork
- **Animated GIF Creation**: Generate GIFs optimized for Slack size constraints

**Security & Analysis**
- **CodeQL/Semgrep**: Static analysis and vulnerability detection
- **Variant Analysis**: Security pattern recognition across codebases
- **Web Fuzzing**: Guidance for security testing web applications
- **Threat Hunting with Sigma Rules**: Security analysis workflows

**Enterprise & Communication**
- **Brand Guidelines Application**: Apply consistent brand voice and style
- **Internal Communications**: Status reports, newsletters, FAQs
- **Ticket Integration**: Connect to ticketing systems, read requirements, update status

### How Teams Are Using Skills

**Development Workflow Integration**

Teams integrate skills into their daily development workflows in several patterns:

1. **Ticket-to-PR Automation**: One documented case study shows a team connecting Claude Code to their ticket system via MCP servers. Claude reads tickets, understands requirements, implements features, updates ticket status, and creates new tickets for discovered bugs. A `/ticket` command handles the entire workflow from acceptance criteria to PR linking.

2. **Parallel Session Development**: Claude Code's creator runs multiple sessions in parallel (5 locally, 5-10 on the web), each using separate git checkouts. The workflow starts with Plan mode, iterating until satisfied with the plan, then switching to auto-accept edits for one-shot implementation.

3. **Ticket Triage**: Teams use skills to read tickets, analyze the codebase, and leave implementation comments before engineers pick up the work, essentially starting "halfway through already."

**Quality Assurance Patterns**

- **UI Testing Feedback Loops**: "Claude tests every single change I land to claude.ai/code using the Claude Chrome extension. It opens a browser, tests the UI, and iterates until the code works and the UX feels good."
- **Automated Quality Gates**: Hooks auto-format code, run tests on file changes, type-check TypeScript, and block edits on protected branches.

### Case Studies and ROI

**Production Case Studies**
- Five documented production case studies validate an average ROI of 6,444% with payback periods under 3 weeks
- Teams using skills report 73% reduction in repetitive prompt engineering time compared to traditional approaches (per Anthropic internal benchmarks)

**Anthropic's Production Skills**
The document skills (docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx) are described as "source-available, not open source, but shared with developers as a reference for more complex skills that are actively used in a production AI application" - specifically powering Claude's document editing capabilities.

### Ecosystem Adoption

**Agent Platforms Supporting Skills**

The Agent Skills format has been adopted by 28+ platforms:
- Claude Code, Claude.ai, Claude API
- OpenAI Codex
- Cursor (nightly channel)
- VS Code / GitHub Copilot
- Gemini CLI
- OpenCode
- Vercel
- Amp, Letta, Goose
- Roo Code, Factory, Firebender
- Spring AI (Java ecosystem)
- Databricks
- And many others

**Cross-Platform Portability**

Skills originally created for Claude Code have evolved into the Agent Skills open standard. The same skill works across Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and other compatible tools, enabling "build once, deploy everywhere" capability sharing.

### Notable Skill Collections

### Installation and Usage Examples

```bash
# Install skills CLI
npm i skills

# List available skills in a repository
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --list

# Install specific skills
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill frontend-design --skill skill-creator

# Install to specific agents
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills -a claude-code -a opencode

# Interactive search
npx skills find

# Search by keyword
npx skills find typescript
```

### Skill Structure

Every skill follows a standard format:
```
skill-name/
  SKILL.md        # Required - frontmatter + instructions
  scripts/        # Optional - executable code
  templates/      # Optional - fill-in templates
  references/     # Optional - detailed documentation
  assets/         # Optional - fonts, images, etc.
```

The SKILL.md file uses YAML frontmatter for metadata (name, description) followed by markdown instructions. Skills employ "progressive disclosure" - metadata uses ~100 tokens, full instructions under 5k tokens, and bundled resources only load as needed.
