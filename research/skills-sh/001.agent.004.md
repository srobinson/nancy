## Summary

skills.sh is Vercel's open agent skills ecosystem, launched January 2026, providing a CLI package manager (`npx skills`) and directory/leaderboard at skills.sh for discovering and installing modular skill packages across 28+ AI coding assistants. The ecosystem has seen rapid adoption with 20,000+ installs within hours of launch, and the underlying Agent Skills specification (originated by Anthropic) has become an open standard adopted by OpenAI, Google, GitHub, and others, creating true cross-platform skill portability.

└── resources/        # Optional: examples, templates, assets
```

**SKILL.md Format**
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---

## Instructions
[Detailed markdown instructions the agent follows]

**Comparison with MCP (Model Context Protocol)**

| Aspect | Agent Skills | MCP |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| Purpose | Teach AI *how* to do tasks | Give AI *access* to external systems |
| Format | Simple SKILL.md markdown files | Full specification with server implementation |
| Token Usage | Lightweight, progressive disclosure | Can consume 10,000+ tokens |
| Complexity | Low barrier to entry | Requires implementation effort |
| Security | Sandboxed instructions | 43% of implementations have injection vulnerabilities |

Skills and MCP are complementary: MCP provides tool connectivity, Skills provide domain expertise.

**Other Alternatives**
- **Google A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**: Protocol for orchestrating multiple AI agents
- **LangChain/LangGraph**: Framework with modular components for LLM applications
- **Semantic Kernel**: Microsoft's agent framework that can consume MCP servers

### Specification and Standards

The Agent Skills specification originated at Anthropic and has been adopted as an open standard:

- **Origin**: Anthropic released the Agent Skills specification in December 2025
- **OpenAI Adoption**: Same format used in Codex CLI and ChatGPT
- **Documentation**: [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)
- **GitHub Standard**: Skills in `.github/skills/` work with GitHub Copilot

**Key Specification Features**
- Progressive disclosure: metadata loads early, full instructions only when relevant
- Portable across any agent that reads the SKILL.md format
- Version-controlled and shareable
- Multiple skills can run together for complex tasks
