## Summary

skills.sh is Vercel's package manager CLI for the open Agent Skills ecosystem, often described as "the npm for AI agents." It enables developers to install, manage, and distribute reusable skill packages that extend AI coding agents' capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tool integrations. The underlying Agent Skills specification is an open standard created by Anthropic in December 2025, which has been widely adopted by major AI platforms including Microsoft, OpenAI, GitHub, Cursor, and Vercel.

## Key Findings

### What is skills.sh?

skills.sh is a command-line tool (`npx skills`) created by Vercel Labs for managing Agent Skills - reusable instruction sets that extend coding agent capabilities. The CLI was officially launched on January 20-21, 2026, and achieved 20,000+ installs within the first six hours, demonstrating significant market demand for standardized skill distribution.

The tool serves as:
1. **A package manager** for installing skills from various sources (GitHub, GitLab, local directories)
2. **A discovery platform** via skills.sh website for browsing skills by category and popularity
3. **An update manager** for keeping installed skills current

### Core Concepts & Terminology

**Agent Skills**: Folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to perform better at specific tasks. Skills are defined in `SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter.

**SKILL.md**: The required file in every skill containing:
- YAML frontmatter with `name` (required, max 64 chars, lowercase hyphen-case) and `description` (required, max 1024 chars)
- Optional fields: `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`
- Markdown body with detailed instructions (recommended under 5000 tokens)

**Skill Directory Structure**:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: instructions + metadata
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
├── references/       # Optional: documentation
└── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources
```

**Progressive Disclosure**: Skills load context efficiently:
1. Metadata (~100 tokens) loaded at startup for all skills
2. Full SKILL.md body loaded when skill is activated
3. Additional resources loaded only when needed

### History & Origins

**The Agent Skills Specification** was created by Anthropic and released as an open standard on December 18, 2025. The specification is maintained at agentskills.io and in the `agentskills/agentskills` GitHub repository (created December 16, 2025).

Key timeline:
- **December 18, 2025**: Anthropic publishes Agent Skills as an open standard
- **December 19-20, 2025**: OpenCode, Cursor, Amp, GitHub, VS Code adopt the standard; OpenAI adds Codex support
- **January 20, 2026**: Vercel announces skills.sh and the skills CLI
- **January 21, 2026**: skills.sh achieves 20,000+ installs in first six hours

**Creators**:
- **Agent Skills Specification**: Anthropic (Mahesh Murag, Product Manager, led the initiative)
- **skills CLI (npx skills)**: Vercel Labs
- **skills.sh Platform**: Vercel (Andrew Qu, Chief of Software, announced)

### How It Works

**Installation Methods**:
```bash
# GitHub shorthand
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills

# Full GitHub URL
npx skills add https://github.com/owner/repo

# Specific skill
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill frontend-design

# Target specific agents
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills -a claude-code -a opencode

# Install all skills
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --all
```

**Other Commands**:
```bash
npx skills find              # Interactive search (fzf-style)
npx skills find typescript   # Keyword search
npx skills check             # Check for updates
npx skills update            # Update all skills
npx skills init [name]       # Create new skill template
npx skills generate-lock     # Track installed skills
```

**Installation Scopes**:
- **Project-level** (default): `./<agent>/skills/` - shared with team
- **Global** (`-g` flag): `~/<agent>/skills/` - available everywhere

**Installation Modes**:
- **Symlink** (default): Single source of truth, easy updates
- **Copy**: Independent copies for each agent

### Supported Agents

The CLI supports 28+ AI coding agents including:
- Claude Code
- Cursor
- OpenCode
- GitHub Copilot
- Codex (OpenAI)
- Cline
- Amp
- Gemini CLI
- Goose
- Kiro CLI
- Windsurf
- Trae
- And many more

### Available Skills (Vercel's agent-skills repository)

1. **react-best-practices**: 40+ rules across 8 categories for React/Next.js performance
2. **web-design-guidelines**: 100+ rules for accessibility, performance, and UX
3. **react-native-guidelines**: 16 rules across 7 sections for mobile development
4. **composition-patterns**: React component architecture patterns
5. **vercel-deploy-claimable**: Instant deployment with framework auto-detection

### Key Differentiators

1. **Open Standard**: Skills work across multiple AI platforms, not locked to any vendor
2. **Cross-Agent Compatibility**: Same skill format works with Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Codex, etc.
3. **Progressive Loading**: Efficient token usage through on-demand resource loading
4. **Community-Driven**: Open to contributions, with leaderboard tracking popularity

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `INSTALL_INTERNAL_SKILLS` | Show/install skills marked as `internal: true` |
| `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` | Disable anonymous usage telemetry |
| `DO_NOT_TRACK` | Alternative telemetry disable method |
